Until now, trying to style an article, document, or blog post with Tailwind has been a tedious task that required a keen eye for typography and a lot of complex custom CSS.

By default, Tailwind removes all of the default browser styling from paragraphs, headings, lists and more. This ends up being really useful for building application UIs because you spend less time undoing user-agent styles, but when you really are just trying to style some content that came from a rich-text editor in a CMS or a markdown file, it can be surprising and unintuitive.


*Why is Tailwind removing the default styles on my h1 elements? How do I disable this?
What do you mean I lose all the other base styles too?
We hear you, but we're not convinced that simply disabling our base styles is what you really want.
You don't want to have to remove annoying margins every time you use a p element in a piece of your dashboard UI.
And I doubt you really want your blog posts to use the user-agent styles either â€” you want them to look awesome, not awful.*
